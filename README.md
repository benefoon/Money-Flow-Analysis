## 🚨 Suspicious Money Flow Analysis 🚨  
## 🌟 **Project Overview**

💡 **Suspicious Money Flow Analysis** is a cutting-edge tool designed to detect and analyze anomalies in financial transactions. Using graph theory, machine learning, and advanced visualization techniques, this project identifies suspicious activities like **money laundering**, **terrorism financing**, and **tax evasion**.  

Key Highlights:  
- 🧠 **Graph Analysis**: Model complex transaction networks and extract key metrics.  
- 🔍 **Machine Learning**: Train models to flag potentially illegal transactions.  
- 📊 **Visualization**: Interactive dashboards for real-time monitoring.  
- 🔔 **Alerts**: Automated alert generation for suspicious activities.

### **Prerequisites**
1. Install Python 3.9 or higher.  
2. Install Docker (optional, for containerized deployment).  
3. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/suspicious-money-flow.git
   cd suspicious-money-flow
   ```

---

### **Installation**
1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
2. Set up the environment (optional):
   ```bash
   python setup.py install
   ```

---

### **Usage**

#### **1. Data Preprocessing**
Clean and normalize raw transaction data:
```bash
python src/data_processing.py
```

#### **2. Graph Analysis**
Build and analyze graphs to detect anomalies:
```bash
python src/graph_analysis.py
```

#### **3. Machine Learning Training**
Train the ML models using processed transaction data:
```bash
python notebooks/03_ml_training.ipynb
```

#### **4. Run Dashboard**
Launch the Streamlit dashboard for visualization and monitoring:
```bash
python dashboards/dashboard.py
```

#### **5. Run Tests**
Ensure the codebase works as expected by running unit tests:
```bash
pytest tests/
```
